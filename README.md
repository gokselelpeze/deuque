# DeuQue
 
This project was made as a semester project of the CME 3201 DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS course.

We created the name DeuQue from our university's abbreviation DEU, and by combining the deque.
DeuQue is a survey site where users can create and share surveys as they wish, and view the results in detailed graphics.
